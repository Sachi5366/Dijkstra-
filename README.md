# Dijkstra's Algorithm in C++

This is a simple implementation of **Dijkstra's Algorithm** in **C++** using an **adjacency list** and **priority queue (min-heap)** for efficient computation of shortest paths in a weighted graph (with non-negative weights).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Efficient shortest path calculation from a single source node
- Uses C++ STL (`vector`, `priority_queue`, `pair`)
- Clean and readable code
- Time Complexity: `O((V + E) * log V)`

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Basic knowledge of graphs and Dijkstra's algorithm

### Compilation

Use the following command to compile the program:

```bash
g++ dijkstra.cpp -o dijkstra
